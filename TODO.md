# ToDo
- [x] Get Python portion of pyxel running in browser
- [ ] Make Pyodide version of Rust Module
    - [x] Find basic requirements.

        - [x] understand logs
            - Python version is incorrectly configured https://pyo3.rs/v0.14.2/building_and_distribution.html
            - Turns out Pyo3-Rust is not a solved problem https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/issues/1973
            - Best case is to try this branch https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/2081
    - [ ] Use custom pyodide version to build this.
        - [x] Build custom Pyodide on Docker
            - This took hours to run.
